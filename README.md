# nashorn-lib

This project is my private toolbox where I just put commonly used functionalities.
Unlike rhox, its not intended as a standalone product and does not have a good documentation, stability or anything.
It's just reusable stuff I found helpful to use in my day-to-day javascriping.

Of course, if you like some scripts, then clone this repo, check it out or do anything you like to do with it. :-)
